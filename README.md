# FluidSimulation
This project simulates the interaction between a 2D fluid and randomly moving particles. The fluid affects particle motion, and particles feed back into the fluid dynamics. Implemented in Python, it includes separate steps for the fluid alone, particles alone, and the fully coupled system, demonstrating how the system evolves over time.
